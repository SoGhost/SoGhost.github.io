tutorial 辅导
>I made a tutorial on ways you can go about making a melon combat system with unity and c-sharp and so i thought i only normal to fallow up with a ranged combat video by the end of this tutorial you'll have a character capable of handling a ranged weapon that rotates to face the mouse cursor and then shoots cool looking arrows that kill enemies of course you'll be able to a plan you learn during this video to make all kinds of range shooting systems from huge powerful bullets and rockets to delicate little arrows now everything taugh here can be applied to any game in need for a shooting system without a child i'm sure or a side-scorlling platformer so as you can see i've set up this little seam with an archer like character who carries a simple ranged weapon and i can move left and right i also got an enemy character i'll use has targets.First of all want to get this weapon rotating so it faces the mouse cursor ,so i'll create a new C-sharp jump script called weapon drag and drop it onto the weapon and open it up now notice that the small chunk of code were about to write about to write to get the weapon rotating looks a little alien but they're not necessarily very easy to understand but don't worry once it's done the rest will be a lot easier ,so basically need to calculate the angel we need to rotate around so that our weapon points towards the mouse cursor we do ,so by first calculating the direction between the weapon and the mouse cursor remeber that to get Direction all you need to do is subtract the destination position at all the cursor with the origin which is a humectant position now here comes the tricky line of code in which we will calculate the amount of degrees our weapon must rotate to face their cursor using that direction vector ,because now we konw in which direction the weapon should be facing ,so we'll set how many degrees must rotate around to reach in that direction lastly we can set the weapon rotation with zero in the x and y for the z axis which is the axis we want our weapons rotate along i'll type rotten Z which is the amount of degrees we established here plus offsets which is a public floor variable i'll treat
